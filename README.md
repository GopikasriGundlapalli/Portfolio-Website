# Portfolio-Website

This portfolio website is a responsive and interactive web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. It provides a structured and visually appealing platform for presenting my technical expertise and professional journey.

The website is structured into four main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The Home section provides a brief introduction, giving visitors an overview of who I am and my passion for web development. The About section elaborates on my background, including my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, which form the foundation of my web development expertise. This section serves as a quick summary of my technical capabilities and interests.

One of the key highlights of this portfolio is the Projects section, which showcases some of the significant projects I have worked on. These include the Responsive Portfolio, which is this very website designed to represent my work and capabilities; AI Resume Crafter, a smart resume-building tool that helps users create professional and customizable resumes; and the Task Manager App, a web application that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with features like adding, tracking, completing, and deleting tasks.

The Contact section provides professional networking opportunities by displaying my email and LinkedIn profile, making it easier for potential employers, recruiters, or collaborators to connect with me. Additionally, the website is fully responsive, ensuring a user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The use of JavaScript adds interactivity, enhancing the overall engagement of visitors.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – Structuring content for accessibility and readability.
CSS3 – Styling and enhancing the visual appeal with responsive design.
JavaScript – Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Through this project, I have strengthened my front-end development skills and learned how to design and implement user-friendly web applications. This portfolio not only serves as a platform to present my work but also as a demonstration of my ability to build modern and responsive websites.
